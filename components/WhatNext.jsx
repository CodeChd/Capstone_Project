        <p>Where God is calling us to go as a church will be difficult, exhilarating and nothing short of an adventure that we’ll be talking about for generations to come. God really knows what He’s doing and that’s why we’re committed to simply listen and obey and leave the consequences up to Him. We believe this is what God will do because this is what He has always done. Follow along with the progress of the “Go & Make” initiative.</p>
