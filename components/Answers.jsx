                        GOD IS HOLY.
                        <span>We are sinful, and our sin separates us from Him.</span>
                        <span>Everyone has sinned and is far away from God’s saving presence. – Romans 3:23</span>

                        GOD IS MERCIFUL.
                        <span>In His love, He made the only way for us to be reconciled to Him: through His son, Jesus Christ. Jesus had to die on the cross for our sins and be raised to life for eternity.</span>

                        <span>But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him. – Romans 5:8</span>

                        <span>I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me. – John 14:6</span>

                        GOD IS GRACIOUS.
                        <span> By placing our faith in Jesus Christ, we are forgiven of our sins and saved from eternal death.</span>



                        <span> For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. – John 3:16</span>


                        <span>
                            For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. – Ephesians 2:8-9

                    <span>Lord Jesus, I need You. I confess that I am a sinner. I believe that You died on the cross to pay for all my sins. With Your help, I will turn away from my sins. Please come into my life and be my Savior and my Master. I accept Your gift of eternal life. Make me the kind of new person You want me to be. Thank You for giving me eternal life. Amen.</span>

                        GOD KEEPS HIS PROMISES.

                       <span>You can be sure that you have eternal life when you trust in Jesus.</span> 



                   <span>And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life. 1 John 5:11-13</span>
